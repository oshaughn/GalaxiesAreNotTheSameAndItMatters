 abstract = {  We investigate how star-forming galaxies typically assemble their masses at high redshift. Using the deep multi-wavelength coverage of the GOODS dataset, we measure stellar mass of a large sample of star-forming galaxies at z~4 and 5, and make a robust determination of stellar mass function (SMF). We report a broad correlation between stellar mass and UV luminosity, such that more UV-luminous galaxies are, on average, more massive. However, the correlation has a substantial intrinsic scatter evidenced by a non-negligible number of UV-faint but massive galaxies. Furthermore, the low-mass end of the SMF does not rise as steeply as the UV luminosity function (alpha_UVLF) -(1.7-1.8), alpha_SMF -(1.3-1.4)) of the same galaxies. In a smooth formation scenario where star formation (SF) is sustained at the observed rates for a long time, these galaxies would have accumulated more mass (by a factor of ~3) than observed and therefore the SMF would mirror more closely that of the UVLF. The relatively shallow slope of the SMF is due to the fact that many of the UV-selected galaxies are not massive enough, and therefore are too faint in their rest-frame optical bands, to be detected in the current observations. Our results favor a episodic formation history in which SF in low-mass galaxies vary significantly over time, a scenario favored by galaxy clustering. Our findings for the UV-faint galaxies are in contrast with those found for more UV-luminous galaxies, which exhibit tighter SFR-M_star correlations. The discrepancy may suggest that galaxies at different luminosities may have different evolutionary paths.},

  abstract={This paper presents theoretical star formation and chemical enrichment histories for the stellar halo of the Milky Way based on new chemodynamical modeling. The goal of this study is to assess the extent to which metal-poor stars in the halo reflect the star formation conditions that occurred in halo progenitor galaxies at high redshift, before and during the epoch of reionization. Simple prescriptions that translate dark-matter halo mass into baryonic gas budgets and star formation histories yield models that resemble the observed Milky Way halo in its total stellar mass, metallicity distribution, and the luminosity function and chemical enrichment of dwarf satellite galaxies. These model halos in turn allow an exploration of how the populations of interest for probing the epoch of reionization are distributed in physical and phase space, and of how they are related to lower-redshift populations of the same metallicity. The fraction of stars dating from before a particular time or redshift depends strongly on radius within the galaxy, reflecting the "inside-out" growth of cold-dark-matter halos, and on metallicity, reflecting the general trend toward higher metallicity at later times. These results suggest that efforts to discover stars from z > 6 - 10 should select for stars with [Fe/H] <~ -3 and favor stars on more tightly bound orbits in the stellar halo, where the majority are from z > 10 and 15 - 40% are from z > 15. The oldest, most metal-poor stars - those most likely to reveal the chemical abundances of the first stars - are most common in the very center of the Galaxy's halo: they are in the bulge, but not of the bulge. These models have several implications for the larger project of constraining the properties of the first stars and galaxies using data from the local Universe.}

 abstract = {  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic nuclei are thought to be a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for the circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital decay of SMBHBs with a range of total masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is in the stalled "secondary-dominated" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of 10^7 years at orbital periods t_var between a day and a year. A dedicated optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance N_var is proportional to t_var^alpha, in a range of periods t_var around tens of weeks. SMBHBs with M &lt; 10^7 M_sun, with 0.5 &lt; alpha &lt; 1.5, would probe the physics of viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass binaries, with alpha=8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The lowest mass SMBHBs (M &lt; 10^{5-6} M_sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short orbital periods, in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are strongly sub-dominant in the last few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved background of near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss constraints on the SMBHB population available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.},

 abstract = {  We investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassive black hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. This is known to be problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binary mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric, shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass comparable to that of the secondary black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally super--Eddington for either hole. The coalescence timescale is therefore always $\sim M_2/\dot M$, where $M_2$ is the secondary black hole mass and $\dot M$ the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.},

We find that the scattering of bound stars shrinks the binary orbit and increases its eccentricity more effectively than that of unbound ambient stars. Binaries with initial eccentricities e>0.3 and/or unequal-mass companions (M_2/M_1<0.1) can decay by three-body interactions to the gravitational wave emission regime in less than a Hubble time. The stellar cusp is significantly eroded, and cores as shallow as \rho\propto r^-0.7 may develop from a pre-existing singular isothermal density profile. A population of HVSs is ejected in the host galaxy halo, with a total mass ~M_2. We scale our results to the scattering of stars bound to Sgr A*, the massive black hole in the Galactic Center, by an inspiraling companion of intermediate mass. Depending on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, and initial slope of the stellar cusp, a core of radius ~0.1 pc typically forms in 1-10 Myr. On this timescale about 500-2500 HVSs are expelled with speeds sufficiently large to escape the gravitational potential of the Milky Way.}

xation alone, and efficiently scatter stars into the binary MBH's orbit. The 3-b
ody star--binary MBH interactions shrink the binary MBH to the point where energ
y loss from the emission of gravitational waves (GW) leads to rapid coalescence.
 We take into account the decreased efficiency of the star-binary MBH interactio
n due to acceleration in the galactic potential, and show that the observed MP a
bundances in galactic nuclei imply binary MBH coalescence times shorter than the
 Hubble time. These events are observable by their strong GW emission. MPs thus 
increase the cosmic rate of these GW events, increase the mass deficit in the st
ellar core, lead to the ejection of hyper-velocity stars, and suppress the forma
tion of triple MBH systems and the resulting ejection of MBHs into intergalactic
 space.},

  abstract={The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally supported nuclear disc of 10^8 solar masses is explored using N-Body/SPH simulations. Gas and star particles are co-present in the disc. Described with a Mestel profile, the disc has a vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by stellar velocity dispersion. A 4 million solar masses primary black hole is placed at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric co-rotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1 to 1, 1 to 4, and to 10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two black holes form a close binary in ~10 Myrs. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We have revealed the occurrence of radial inflows around each individual black hole that can create small gaseous Keplerian disc weighing ~2 \% of the black hole mass, and of size ~0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double AGN activity is expected to occur on an estimated timescale of ~10 Myrs, comparable to the inspiral timescale. The double nuclear point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution have typical separations of ~10 pc.}

  abstract={We study the long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at the centers of galaxies using detailed scattering experiments to solve the full three-body problem. Ambient stars drawn from an isotropic Maxwellian distribution unbound to the binary are ejected by the gravitational slingshot. We construct a minimal, hybrid model for the depletion of the loss cone and the orbital decay of the binary and show that secondary slingshots-stars returning on small-impact parameter orbits to have a second superelastic scattering with the MBHB-may considerably help the shrinking of the pair in the case of large binary mass ratios. In the absence of loss cone refilling by two-body relaxation or other processes, the mass ejected before the stalling of a MBHB is half the binary reduced mass. About 50% of the ejected stars are expelled in a ``burst'' lasting ~104 yr M1/46, where M6 is the binary mass in units of 106 Msolar. The loss cone is completely emptied in a few bulge crossing timescales, ~107 yr M1/46. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation or gas dynamical processes, unequal mass and/or eccentric binaries with M6>~0.1 can shrink to the gravitational wave emission regime in less than a Hubble time and are therefore ``safe'' targets for the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.}

  abstract={We use full three-body scattering experiments to study the ejection of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) by massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at the centers of galaxies. Ambient stars drawn from a Maxwellian distribution unbound to the binary are expelled by the gravitational slingshot. Accurate measurements of thermally averaged hardening, mass ejection, and eccentricity growth rates (H, J, and K) for MBHBs in a fixed stellar background are obtained by numerical orbit integration from initial conditions determined by Monte Carlo techniques. Three-body interactions create a subpopulation of HVSs on nearly radial orbits, with a spatial distribution that is initially highly flattened in the inspiral plane of the MBHB, but becomes more isotropic with decreasing binary separation. The degree of anisotropy is smaller for unequal mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities. Eccentric MBHBs produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity stars and break planar symmetry, ejecting HVSs along a broad jet perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet two-sidedness decreases with increasing binary mass ratio, while the jet opening angle increases with decreasing kick velocity and orbital separation. The detection of a numerous population of HVSs in the halo of the Milky Way by the next generation of large astrometric surveys such as Gaia may provide a unique signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at the Galactic center.}

  abstract = {Galaxies with stellar bulges are generically observed to host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The hierarchical merging of galaxies should therefore lead to the formation of SMBH binaries. Merging of old massive galaxies with little gas promotes the formation of low-density nuclei where SMBH binaries are expected to survive over long times. If the binary lifetime exceeds the typical time between mergers, then triple black hole (BH) systems may form. We study the statistics of close triple SMBH encounters in galactic nuclei by computing a series of three-body orbits with physically motivated initial conditions appropriate for giant elliptical galaxies. Our simulations include a smooth background potential consisting of a stellar bulge plus a dark matter halo, drag forces due to gravitational radiation and dynamical friction on the stars and dark matter, and a simple model of the time evolution of the inner density profile under heating and mass ejection by the SMBHs. We find that the binary pair coalesces as a result of repeated close encounters in ~85 per cent of our runs, and in ~15 per cent of cases a new eccentric binary forms from the third SMBH and binary remnant and coalesces during the run time. In about 40 per cent of the runs the lightest BH is left wandering through the galactic halo or escapes the galaxy altogether, but escape of all three SMBHs is exceedingly rare. The triple systems typically scour out cores with mass deficits ~one-two times their total mass, which can help to account for the large cores observed in some massive elliptical galaxies, such as M87. The high coalescence rate, prevalence of very high-eccentricity orbits, and gravitational radiation `spikes' during close encounters in our runs, may provide interesting signals for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)}

  abstract={We explore the nature of possible electromagnetic counterparts of coalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological distances detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). An electromagnetic precursor, during the last year of gravitational wave (GW)-driven inspiral, or an afterglow within few years after coalescence, may highlight the position in the sky of galaxies hosting the LISA sources. We show that observations of precursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending on the mass of the primary black hole. Precursors are expected to occur in binaries where the primary (more massive) black hole is heavier than ~107Msolar. They may correspond to on-off states of accretion, that is, to a bright X-ray source decaying into quiescence before black hole coalescence, and are likely associated to disturbed galaxies showing signs of ongoing starbursts. Coalescences of lighter binaries, with masses <~5 × 106Msolar, lack of any precursor, as gas is expected to be consumed long before the GW-driven orbital decay. Such events would not be hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associated starburst, given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the typical time-scale of starbursts. In contrast, coalescence, for such light binaries, is followed by an electromagnetic afterglow, that is, an off-on accretion state rising in 20 yr. Using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show that future X-ray missions such as the XEUS will be able to identify, in 20-yr operation, almost all the massive BH binaries detectable by the LISA and, in only 5 yr, all the LISA sources at z > 6.}

Here we follow a different approach and focus on the population of stars which is bound to the binary and so far has not received much attention. With simple assumptions which should not be sensitive to initial conditions we derive a lower limit for the mass of stars which needs to be ejected by the binary in order to coalesce. We also compute this mass in dependence on the steepness of the density profile according to which the stars are distributed. Our results are not as pessimistic as earlier conclusions and actually suggest that the BHs merge.},

                   halos formed in a hierarchical ΛCDM universe. We
                   identify tidal debris in the simulations according to
                   the current best surface brightness detection limits
                   in M31 and demonstrate that bright features in the
                   outer halo regions usually originate from single
                   satellites, with very little contamination from other
                   sources due to the low probability of tidal streams
                   from two overlapping accretion events. In contrast,
                   high surface brightness features in the inner halo
                   often originate from multiple progenitors. We also
                   compare the age and metallicity distribution of the
                   debris with the well-mixed stellar halos in which
                   they reside. We find that high surface brightness
                   tidal debris is produced almost exclusively by
                   relatively high mass progenitors (M*~107-109Msolar)
                   and thus is expected to be of moderate to high
                   metallicity. Similarly, in our models the smooth
                   inner halo is expected to be metal-rich, as this
                   region has been built up mainly from massive
                   satellites. Our results imply that the stellar
                   populations of substructure observed around external
                   galaxies with current techniques should not resemble
                   old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidal satellites, nor
                   the underlying component of the stellar halo},

                   main-sequence stars (0.2<g-r<0.6), we develop
                   polynomial models for estimating these parameters
                   from the SDSS u-g and g-r colors. These photometric
                   estimates have similar error properties as those
                   determined from SDSS spectra. We apply this method to
                   SDSS photometric data for over 2 million F/G stars
                   and measure the unbiased metallicity distribution for
                   a complete volume-limited sample of stars at
                   distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. The metallicity
                   distribution can be exquisitely modeled using two
                   components with a spatially varying number ratio,
                   which correspond to disk and halo. The two components
                   also possess the kinematics expected for disk and
                   halo stars. The metallicity of the halo component is
                   spatially invariant, while the median disk
                   metallicity smoothly decreases with distance from the
                   Galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to -0.8 beyond
                   several kiloparsecs. The absence of a correlation
                   between metallicity and kinematics for disk stars is
                   in a conflict with the traditional decomposition in
                   terms of thin and thick disks. We detect coherent
                   substructures in the kinematics-metallicity space,
                   such as the Monoceros stream, which rotates faster
                   than the LSR, and has a median metallicity of
                   [Fe/H]=-0.95, with an rms scatter of only ~0.15 dex.

                   metallicity distribution (DMD) of the Milky Way halo,
                   a semi-analytical model is presented in the framework
                   of the hierarchical merging paradigm for structure
                   formation. Methods: It is assumed that the Milky Way
                   halo is composed of a number of sub-haloes with
                   properties either as observed in the dwarf satellite
                   galaxies of the Local group (shape of metallicity
                   distribution, effective yield) or derived from
                   calculations of structure formation (sub-halo
                   distribution function). Results: With reasonable
                   assumptions for the parameters involved, we find that
                   the overall shape and effective yield of the Galactic
                   halo DMD can be reproduced in the framework of such a
                   simple model. The low metallicity tail of the DMD
                   presents a deficiency of stars with respect to the
                   simple model predictions (akin to the G-dwarf problem
                   in the solar neighborhood); it is suggested that an
                   early infall phase can account for that problem, as
                   well as for the observed DMDs of dwarf satellite
                   galaxies. Conclusions: Accretion of galaxies similar
                   (but not identical) to the progenitors of present day
                   dwarf satellites of the Milky Way may well have

                   history in terms of the characteristic epoch of
                   accretion and mass and orbits of progenitor objects.
                   The study utilizes a suite of 11 stellar halo models
                   constructed within the context of a standard ΛCDM
                   cosmology. The results demonstrate that
                   coordinate-space studies are sensitive to the recent
                   (0-8 Gyr ago) merger histories of galaxies (this
                   timescale corresponds to the last few percent to tens
                   of percent of mass accretion for a Milky Way-type
                   galaxy). Specifically, the frequency, sky coverage,
                   and fraction of stars in substructures in the stellar
                   halo as a function of surface brightness are
                   indicators of the importance of recent merging and of
                   the luminosity function of infalling dwarfs. The
                   morphology of features serves as a guide to the
                   orbital distribution of those dwarfs. Constraints on
                   the earlier merger history (>8 Gyr ago) can be
                   gleaned from the abundance patterns in halo stars:
                   within our models, dramatic differences in the
                   dominant epoch of accretion or luminosity function of
                   progenitor objects leave clear signatures in the
                   [α/Fe] and [Fe/H] distributions of the stellar halo;
                   halos dominated by very early accretion have higher
                   average [α/Fe], while those dominated by
                   high-luminosity satellites have higher [Fe/H]. This
                   insight can be applied to reconstruct much about the
                   merger histories of nearby galaxies from current and
                   future data sets.},

                   formation (SF) history using the more than fifty
                   large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations that
                   together comprise the OverWhelmingly Large
                   Simulations (OWLS) project. We systematically vary
                   the parameters of the model to determine which
                   physical processes are dominant and which aspects of
                   the model are robust. Generically, we find that SF is
                   limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high
                   redshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate
                   redshift, then decreases as it is quenched by lower
                   cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas
                   exhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars
                   and black holes. The higher redshift SF is therefore
                   mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and
                   to a lesser extent by photo-heating from
                   reionization. The location and height of the peak in
                   the SF history, and the steepness of the decline
                   towards the present, depend on the physics and
                   implementation of stellar and black hole feedback.
                   Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line
                   cooling both boost the SF rate at late times.
                   Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated fashion at a
                   rate controlled by the balance between, on the one
                   hand, feedback from massive stars and black holes
                   and, on the other hand, gas cooling and accretion.
                   Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to
                   the assumed SF law. This can be understood in terms
                   of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency is changed,
                   then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to
                   achieve the same rate of production of massive stars.
                   Self-regulated feedback from accreting black holes is
                   required to match the steep decline in the observed
                   SF rate below redshift two, although more extreme
                   feedback from SF, for example in the form of a
                   top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.},

                   processes that drive the evolution of the cosmic star
                   formation density in cold dark matter universes.
                   Based on our analysis, we formulate a model to
                   characterise the redshift dependence of the star
                   formation history and compare it to results obtained
                   from a set of hydrodynamic simulations which include
                   star formation and feedback. At early times,
                   densities are sufficiently high and cooling times
                   sufficiently short that abundant quantities of
                   star-forming gas are present in all dark matter halos
                   that can cool by atomic processes. Consequently, the
                   star formation density generically rises
                   exponentially as z decreases, independent of the
                   details of the physical model for star formation, but
                   dependent on the normalisation and shape of the
                   cosmological power spectrum. This part of the
                   evolution is dominated by gravitationally driven
                   growth of the halo mass function. At low redshifts,
                   densities decline as the universe expands to the
                   point that cooling is inhibited, limiting the amount
                   of star-forming gas available. We find that in this
                   regime the star formation rate scales approximately
                   in proportion to the cooling rate within halos. We
                   derive analytic expressions for the full star
                   formation history and show that they match our
                   simulation results to better than ~10%. Using various
                   approximations, we reduce the expressions to a simple
                   analytic fitting function that can be used to compute
                   global cosmological quantities that are directly
                   related to the star formation history. As examples,
                   we consider the integrated stellar density, the
                   supernova and gamma-ray burst rates observable on

                   population of galaxies. Using as input the available
                   data from quasar absorption-line surveys, optical
                   imaging and redshift surveys, and the COBE DIRBE and
                   FIRAS extragalactic infrared background measurements,
                   we obtain solutions for the cosmic histories of
                   stars, interstellar gas, heavy elements, dust, and
                   radiation from stars and dust in galaxies. Our
                   solutions reproduce remarkably well a wide variety of
                   observations that were not used as input. These
                   include the integrated background light from galaxy
                   counts from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared
                   wavelengths, the rest-frame optical and near-infrared
                   emissivities at various redshifts from surveys of
                   galaxies, the mid-infrared and far-infrared
                   emissivities of the local universe from the IRAS
                   survey, the mean abundance of heavy elements at
                   various epochs from surveys of damped Lyalpha
                   systems, and the global star formation rates at
                   several redshifts from Hα, mid-infrared, and
                   submillimeter observations. The chemical enrichment
                   history of the intergalactic medium implied by our
                   models is also consistent with the observed mean
                   metal content of the Lyalpha forest at high
                   redshifts. We infer that the dust associated with
                   star-forming regions is highly inhomogeneous and
                   absorbs a significant fraction of the starlight, with
                   only 41\%-46\% of the total in the extragalactic
                   optical background and the remaining 59\%-54\%
                   reprocessed by dust into the infrared background. The
                   solutions presented here provide an intriguing
                   picture of the cosmic mean history of galaxies over
                   much of the Hubble time. In particular, the process
                   of galaxy formation appears to have undergone an
                   early period of substantial inflow to assemble
                   interstellar gas at z>~3, a subsequent period of
                   intense star formation and chemical enrichment at
                   1<~z<~3, and a recent period of decline in the gas
                   content, star formation rate, optical stellar
                   emissivity, and infrared dust emissivity at},

  abstract =      {GRB 080913, discovered by SWIFT, is the most distant
                   gamma-ray burst (GRB) known to-date, with a
                   spectroscopically determined redshift of z=6.7. The
                   detection of a burst at such an early epoch of the
                   Universe significantly constrains the nature of GRBs
                   and their progenitors. To evaluate these constraints,
                   we perform population synthesis studies of the
                   formation and evolution of early stars and calculate
                   the resulting formation rates of short- and
                   long-duration GRBs at high redshift. The peak of the
                   GRB rate from Population II stars occurs at z=7 for a
                   model with efficient/fast mixing of metals, while it
                   is found at z=3 for an inefficient/slow metallicity
                   evolution model. We show that for at z=6.7
                   essentially all GRBs originate from Population II
                   stars, independent of the adopted metallicity
                   evolution model. At this epoch Population III (metal
                   free) stars, representing the very first generation
                   of stars, most likely have already completed their
                   evolution, and Population I stars (representing the
                   present population) have just begun forming. We argue
                   that Population II stars (having small, but non-zero
                   metallicity) are the most likely progenitors of both
                   long GRBs (collapsars) and short GRBs (NS-NS or BH-NS
                   mergers) in the redshift range 6<z<10. Since the
                   predicted rates, after correction for modeling and
                   observational biases, are very similar at these
                   epochs we cannot definitively conclude which of these
                   two progenitor scenarios is more likely in the case
                   of GRB 080913. Further information about these high-z
                   events, such as their spectral energy distribution
                   and host galaxy properties, will be needed for a much
                   larger sample to consolidate the progenitor models
                   considered here.},

  abstract =      {Aims. By means of chemical evolution models for
                   ellipticals, spirals, and irregular galaxies, we aim
                   at investigating the physical meaning and the
                   redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation,
                   as well as how this relation is connected with galaxy
                   morphology. Methods: Our models distinguish among
                   different morphological types through the use of
                   different infall, outflow, and star formation
                   prescriptions. We assume that galaxy morphologies do
                   not change with cosmic time. We present a method
                   accounting for a spread in the epochs of galaxy
                   formation and refining the galactic mass grid. To do
                   that, we extracted the formation times randomly and
                   assumed an age dispersion Δ_t. We compared our
                   predictions to observational results obtained for
                   galaxies between redshifts 0.07 and 3.5. Results: We
                   reproduce the mass-metallicity (MZ) relation mainly
                   by means of an increasing efficiency of star
                   formation with mass in galaxies of all morphological
                   types, without any need to invokegalactic outflows
                   favoring the loss of metals in the less massive
                   galaxies. Our predictions can help constraining the
                   slope and the zero point of the observed local MZ
                   relation, both affected by uncertainties related to
                   the use of different metallicity calibrations. We
                   show how, by considering the MZ, the O/H vs. star
                   formation rate (SFR), and the SFR vs. galactic mass
                   diagrams at various redshifts, it is possible to
                   constrain the morphology of the galaxies producing
                   these relations. Our results indicate that the
                   galaxies observed at z=3.5 should be mainly
                   proto-ellipticals, whereas at z=2.2 the observed
                   galaxies consist of a morphological mix of
                   proto-spirals and proto-ellipticals. At lower
                   redshifts, the observed MZ relation is reproduced by
                   considering both spirals and irregulars. Galaxies
                   with different star formation histories may overlap
                   in the MZ diagram, but measures of abundance ratios
                   such as [O/Fe] can help to break this degeneracy.
                   Predictions for the MZ relations for other elements
                   (C, N, Mg, Si, Fe) are also presented, with largest
                   dispersions predicted for elements produced in
                   considerable amounts by Type Ia SNe, owing to the
                   long lifetimes of their progenitors.},

                   programme (AMAZE) aimed at determining the evolution
                   of the mass-metallicity relation at z > 3 by means of
                   deep near-IR spectroscopy. Gas metallicities are
                   measured, for an initial sample of nine star forming
                   galaxies at z ~ 3.5, by means of optical nebular
                   lines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are
                   accurately determined by using Spitzer-IRAC data,
                   which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in
                   these distant galaxies. When compared with previous
                   surveys, the mass-metallicity relation inferred at z
                   ~ 3.5 shows an evolution much stronger than observed
                   at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even
                   in massive galaxies, indicating that z ~ 3 is an
                   epoch of major action in terms of star formation and
                   metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are
                   also indications that the metallicity evolution of
                   low mass galaxies is stronger relative to high mass
                   systems, an effect which can be considered the
                   chemical version of the galaxy downsizing. The
                   mass-metallicity relation observed at z ~ 3.5 is
                   difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some
                   hierarchical evolutionary models. Such discrepancies
                   suggest that at z > 3 galaxies are assembled mostly
                   with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small
                   galaxies with low star formation efficiency. The bulk
                   of the star formation and metallicity evolution
                   probably occurs once small galaxies are already
                   assembled into bigger systems.},

  abstract  ={Recovery of the supernova (SN) delay-time distribution (DTD) - the SN rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star formation - can shed light on SN progenitors and physics, as well as on the time-scales of chemical enrichment. Previous attempts to reconstruct the DTD have been based either on comparison of mean SN rates versus redshift to cosmic star-formation history (SFH), or on the comparison of SN rates among galaxies with different mean ages. Here, we present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids the averaging and loss of information of other schemes. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of SNe discovered by a survey in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one SN, rarely a few). We apply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 type-Ia SNe (SNe Ia) and 119 core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS), that have SFHs reconstructed from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra. We find a >2σ SN Ia DTD signal in our shortest-delay, 'prompt' bin at <420 Myr. We identify and study a systematic error, due to the limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, that causes some of the prompt signal to leak to the later bins of the DTD. After accounting for this systematic error, we demonstrate that a prompt SN Ia contribution is required by the data at the >99 per cent confidence level. We further find a 4σ indication of SNe Ia that are 'delayed' by >2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe Ia. We measure the time integral over the SN DTD. For CC SNe we find a total yield of 0.010 ± 0.002 SNe per Msun formed, in excellent agreement with expectations, if all stars more massive than 8 Msun lead to visible SN explosions. This argues against scenarios in which the minimum mass for core-collapse SNe is ≳10 Msun, or in which a significant fraction of massive stars collapse without an accompanying explosion. For SNe Ia, the time-integrated yield is 0.0023 ± 0.0006 SNe per Msun formed, most of them with delays <2.4 Gyr. Finally, we show the robust performance of the method on simulated samples, and demonstrate that its application to already existing SN samples, such as the full LOSS sample, but with complete and unbiased SFH estimates for the survey galaxies, could provide an accurate and detailed measurement of the SN Ia DTD.}

While the Swift/HETE II SHB sample is incompatible with the SHB population that follows the star formation rate, it is compatible with an SHB rate that reflects a distribution of delay times after the SFR. This would be the case if SHBs were associated with binary neutron star mergers. The available data allows, however, different interpretations. For example, a population whose rate is independent of the redshift fits the data very well. The implied SHB rates that we find range from ~8 to ~30~h703 Gpc-3 yr-1. This rate, which is comparable to the rate of neutron star mergers estimated from statistics of binary pulsars, is a much higher rate than what was previously estimated. We stress that our analysis, which is based on observed SHBs, is limited to bursts with luminosities above 1049 erg/s. Weaker bursts may exist, but if so they are hardly detected by BATSE of Swift, so their rate is very weakly constrained by current observations.}

We use population synthesis to construct distributions of gamma-ray bursts(GRBs) for different proposed progenitor models. We use a description of starformation that takes into account the evolution of metallicity with redshiftand galaxy mass, the evolution of galaxy mass with redshift, and the starformation rate with galaxy mass and redshift. We compare predicteddistributions with redshift and metallicity to observations of GRB hostgalaxies and find that the the simple models cannot produce the observeddistributions, but that current theoretical models can reproduce theobservations within some constraints on the fraction of fallback black holesthat produce GRBs.}

We find that both the BATSE and the Swift peak fluxes can be fitted by the same luminosity function and the two samples are compatible with a population that follows the star formation rate. The estimated local long GRB rate (without beaming corrections) varies by a factor of five from 0.05 Gpc^(-3)yr^(-1) for a rate function that has a large fraction of high redshift bursts to 0.27 Gpc^(-3)yr^(-1) for a rate function that has many local ones. We then turn to compare the BeppoSax/HETE2 and the Swift observed redshift distributions and compare them with the predictions of the luminosity function found. We find that the discrepancy between the BeppoSax/HETE2 and Swift observed redshift distributions is only partially explained by the different thresholds of the detectors and it may indicate strong selection effects. After trying different forms of the star formation rate (SFR) we find that the observed Swift redshift distribution, with more observed high redshift bursts than expected, is inconsistent with a GRB rate that simply follows current models for the SFR. We show that this can be explained by GRB evolution beyond the SFR (more high redshift bursts). Alternatively this can also arise if the luminosity function evolves and earlier bursts were more luminous or if strong selection effects affect the redshift determination.},

  abstract={With its rapid-response capability and multiwavelength complement of instruments, the Swift satellite has transformed our physical understanding of γ-ray bursts (GRBs). Providing high-quality observations of hundreds of bursts, and facilitating a wide range of follow-up observations within seconds of each event, Swift has revealed an unforeseen richness in observed burst properties, shed light on the nature of short-duration bursts, and helped realize the promise of GRBs as probes of the processes and environments of star formation out to the earliest cosmic epochs. These advances have opened new perspectives on the nature and properties of burst central engines, interactions with the burst environment from microparsec to gigaparsec scales, and the possibilities for nonphotonic signatures. Our understanding of these extreme cosmic sources has thus advanced substantially; yet, more than 40 years after their discovery, GRBs continue to present major challenges on both observational and theoretical fronts.}

 abstract = {  Abridged: The origin and progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts remain a puzzle and a highly debated topic. The most popular model to interpret short-hard bursts is the merger of two compact stellar objects (NS-NS or NS-BH). A closer analysis by Zhang et al. reveals that a small sample of GRBs that have the most robust evidence of the compact star merger origin (Type I) is not a fair representation of the BATSE short-hard GRB sample. This raises the question whether all short-hard GRBs are Type I, and whether there is a strong contamination of GRBs due to massive star core collapses (Type II) in the short-hard GRB sample. We utilize a Monte Carlo approach to determine whether a merger progenitor model can self-consistently account for all the observations of short-hard GRBs, including a sample with redshift measurements in the Swift era (z-known sample) and the CGRO/BATSE sample. We apply various merger time delay distributions invoked in compact star merger models to derive the redshift distributions of Type I GRBs, and then constrain the unknown luminosity function of Type I GRBs. We find that it is difficult to reconcile a merger scenario progenitor with all the data. In order to satisfy both observational constraints, the allowed merger delay time scale is essentially zero, which suggests that most short GRBs should follow the star forming history of the universe. We explore the possibility that the observed short-hard GRB sample is a mix of Type I (which requires a merger time delay to define the z-distribution) and Type II (whose z-distribution tracks the star forming rate) GRBs. We conclude that Type I GRBs only account for a small fraction of short-hard GRBs and that the majority of short-hard GRBs track the star forming history of the universe and are likely of Type II origin.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery of the first four afterglows of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHBs), suggests that they typically result from long-lived progenitor systems. The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double neutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such events are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by ground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB observations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation of the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection of these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic time, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can reproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux distribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical progenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the typical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution is a power-law with index \eta then \eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \sigma c.l.). This result is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic DNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the observed galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that the local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several orders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that SHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO event rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is not negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic radiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories.}

 abstract = { The frequency of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in galaxies of different spectral type is used here to constrain the lifetime of the progenitors. On average, early-type galaxies have their stars formed earlier than late-type galaxies, and this difference, together with the time delay between progenitor formation and short GRB outburst, leads to different burst rates in the two types of galaxies. Presently available data suggest, but not yet prove, that the short GRB rate in early-type galaxies may be higher than it is in late-type galaxies. This suggests that, unlike Type Ia supernovae, at least half of the short GRB progenitors that can outburst within a Hubble time have lifetimes greater than 10 Gyr. Models of the probability distribution of time delays, here parametrized as P(\tau)\propto \tau^n, with n&gt;3/2 are favored. This apparent long time delay and the fact that early-type galaxies in clusters make a substantial contribution to the local stellar mass inventory can explain the observed preponderance of short GRBs in galaxy clusters.},

Assuming the BC03 stellar population models, we find that more massive galaxies are more metal-rich than less massive ones at all redshifts; the mass-metallicity relation is imprinted in galaxies from the epoch of formation. For galaxies with present stellar masses > 10^{10} Msun, the time evolution of stellar metallicity is very weak, with at most 0.2-0.3 dex over a Hubble time- for this reason the mass-metallicity relation evolves little with redshift. However, for galaxies with present stellar masses < 10^{10} Msun, the evolution is significant, with metallicity increasing by more than a decade from redshift 3 to the present. By being able to recover the metallicity history, we have managed to identify the origin of a recent discrepancy between the metallicity recovered from nebular lines and absorption lines. As expected, we show that the young population dominates the former while the old population the latter. We have investigated the dependence on the stellar models used and find that older stellar population synthesis codes do not produce a clear result. Finally, we have explored the relationship between cluster environment and metallicity, and find a strong correlation in the sense that galaxies in high density regions have high metallicity.}

 abstract = {  There is increasing evidence of a local population of short duration Gamma-ray Bursts (sGRB), but it remains to be seen whether this is a separate population to higher redshift bursts. Here we choose plausible Luminosity Functions (LF) for both neutron star binary mergers and giant flares from Soft Gamma Repeaters (magnetars, SGR), and combined with theoretical and observed Galactic intrinsic rates we examine whether a single population alone of progenitors can reproduce both the overall BATSE sGRB number counts and a local population, or whether a dual progenitor population is required. In addition we compare the predicted redshift distribution from our best fit models with the sGRB redshift distribution from the Swift era. We find that only a bimodal population consisting of lower and higher luminosity populations can reproduce both the overall BATSE sGRB number counts and a local population, as well as being consistent with Swift redshifts. Furthermore, the best fit luminosity parameters agree well with the known properties of SGR giant flares and classic short GRBs.},

  comment = {This is similar to another paper (?) and continues a trend (e.g., me; Nakar, Gal-Yam, Fox; etc..) finding that the short GRB redshift distribution looks hard to fit with just one component.     Additionally, they add value by exploring a plausible but rarely explored set of assumptions regarding the brightness distribution of short GRBs (lognormal).  Effectively, their best fit model is two 'standard candles' with fairly little luminosity variation.  It's very tempting, physically, because that's what one would usually expect for each...but I think it's inconsistent with the old BATSE luminosity function (I haven't checked in detail, but it should be a power law over a few orders of magnitude).}

  abstract={The association of some short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with elliptical galaxies established that their progenitors, unlike those of long GRBs, belong to an old stellar population. However, the majority of short GRBs appear to occur in star forming galaxies, raising the possibility that some progenitors are related to recent star formation activity. Here we present optical spectroscopy of these hosts and measure their luminosities, star formation rates, and metallicities. We find luminosities of L_B~0.1-1.5 L*, star formation rates of SFR~0.2-6 M_sun/yr, and metallicities of 12+log(O/H)~8.5-8.9 (Z~0.6-1.6 Z_sun). A detailed comparison to the hosts of long GRBs reveals systematically higher luminosities, lower specific star formation rates (SFR/L_B) by about an order of magnitude, and higher metallicities by about 0.6 dex. The K-S probability that the short and long GRB hosts are drawn from the same underlying galaxy distribution is only 10^-3. On the other hand, short GRB hosts exhibit excellent agreement with the specific star formation rates and the luminosity-metallicity relation of field galaxies at z~0.1-1. We thus conclude that short GRB hosts are not dominated by young stellar populations like long GRBs hosts. Instead, short GRB hosts appear to be drawn uniformly from the underlying galaxy distribution, indicating that the progenitors have a wide age distribution of several Gyr.}

 abstract = {  [Abridged] We present optical and NIR observations of 19 short GRB host galaxies, aimed at measuring their stellar masses and population ages. The goals of this study are to evaluate whether short GRBs track the stellar mass distribution of galaxies, to investigate the progenitor delay time distribution, and to explore any connection between long and short GRB progenitors. Using single stellar population models we infer masses of log(M/M_sun)=8.8-11.6 and population ages of tau=0.03-4.4 Gyr. We further infer maximal masses of log(M/M_sun)=9.7-11.9 by assuming stellar population ages equal to the age of the universe at each host's redshift. Comparing the distribution of stellar masses to the general galaxy mass function we find that short GRBs track the cosmic stellar mass distribution only if the late-type hosts generally have maximal masses. However, there is an apparent dearth of early-type hosts compared to the equal contribution of early- and late-type galaxies to the cosmic stellar mass budget. These results suggest that stellar mass may not be the sole parameter controlling the short GRB rate, and raise the possibility of a two-component model with both mass and star formation playing a role. If short GRBs in late-type galaxies indeed track the star formation activity, the resulting typical delay time is ~0.2 Gyr, while those in early-type hosts have a typical delay of ~3 Gyr. Using the same stellar population models we fit the data for 22 long GRB hosts and find that they have lower masses and younger population ages, with &lt;log(M/M_sun)&gt;=9.1 and &lt;tau&gt;=0.06 Gyr, respectively; their maximal masses are similarly lower, &lt;log(M/M_sun)&gt;=9.6. Most importantly, the two host populations remain distinct even if we consider only the star-forming hosts of short GRBs, supporting our previous findings that the progenitors of long GRBs and short GRBs in late-type galaxies are distinct.},

  abstract={We present theoretical models for the formation and evolution of populations of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the two elliptical galaxies NGC 3379 and NGC 4278. The models are calculated with the recently updated StarTrack code, assuming only a primordial galactic field LMXB population. StarTrack is an advanced population synthesis code that has been tested and calibrated using detailed binary star calculations and incorporates all the important physical processes of binary evolution. The simulations are targeted to modeling and understanding the origin of the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of point sources in these galaxies. For the first time we explore the population XLF in luminosities below 1037 ergs s-1, as probed by the most recent observational results. We consider models for the formation and evolution of LMXBs in galactic fields with different CE efficiencies, stellar wind prescriptions, magnetic braking laws, and IMFs. We identify models that produce XLFs consistent with the observations both in shape and absolute normalization, suggesting that a primordial galactic field LMXB population can make a significant contribution to the total population of an elliptical galaxy. We also find that the treatment of the outburst luminosity of transient systems remains a crucial factor for the determination of the XLF, since the modeled populations are dominated by transient X-ray systems.}

This discrepancy peaks at z=3 where instantaneous indicators suggest a star formation rate around 0.6 dex higher than those of the best fit to the stellar mass history.

 abstract = { Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. Taken together, the most recent and robust data indicate a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z~6, with especially tight constraints for z &lt; 1. There have also been a number of dedicated efforts to measure or constrain the SFH at z~6 and beyond. It is also possible to constrain the normalisation of the SFH using a combination of electron antineutrino flux limits from Super-Kamiokande measurements and supernova rate density measurements. This review presents the latest compilation of SFH measurements, and summarises the corresponding evolution for stellar and metal mass densities, and supernova rate densities. The constraints on the normalisation of the cosmic SFH, arising from the combination of the supernova rate measurements and the measurement limit on the supernova electron antineutrino flux, are also discussed.},

  abstract={The evolution in the comoving space density of the global average galaxy star formation rate (SFR) out to a redshift around unity is well established. Beyond z~1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is flat or even increasing, contrary to early indications of a turnover. Some recent analyses of z~6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z=3 to z~6, but there is still very little constraint on the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density spanning z=0 to as high as z~6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the entire range 0<z<~6, and it can be used to constrain the evolution of the luminosity function (LF) for star-forming galaxies. The LF evolution for star-forming galaxies has been previously explored using optical source counts, as well as radio source counts at 1.4 GHz, and a well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution [L~(1+z)Q] and density evolution [φ~(1+z)P] is found. Combining the constraints from the global SFR density evolution with those from the 1.4 GHz radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be established. The preferred evolution in a H0=70,ΩM=0.3,ΩΛ=0.7 cosmology from these combined constraints is Q=2.70+/-0.60, P=0.15+/-0.60.}

  abstract = {Strong constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) have recently been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the results of numerous measurements over the past decade. Taken together, the most recent and robust data indicate a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH out to redshift z~6, with especially tight constraints for z<~1. We fit these data with simple analytical forms, and derive conservative bands to indicate possible variations from the best fits. Since the z<~1 SFH data are quite precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together affect the SFH normalisation, to test their accuracy, both in this redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider the evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for supernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of ~3 Gyr. As a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalisation, we consider the Super-Kamiokande (SK) limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<~1. We find consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from SN events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses (<~ 1 solar mass), and we show that recently favoured IMFs are also constrained. In particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although they cannot be too top-heavy. (Abridged)}

 abstract = { Taking three independent approaches, we investigate the simultaneous constraints set on the cosmic star formation history from various observations, including stellar mass density and extragalactic background light (EBL). We compare results based on: 1) direct observations of past light-cone, 2) a model using local fossil evidence constrained by SDSS observations at z~0 (the `Fossil' model), and 3) theoretical ab initio models from three calculations of cosmic star formation history: (a) new (1024)^3 TVD cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, (b) analytic expression of Hernquist &amp; Springel based on cosmological SPH simulations, and (c) semi-analytic model of Somerville et al. We find good agreement among the three independent approaches up to the order of observational errors, except that all the models predict bolometric EBL of I_EBL ~= 40-55 nW m^-2 sr^-1, which is at the lower edge of the the observational estimate by Hauser &amp; Dwek. We emphasize that the Fossil model that consists of two components -- spheroids and disks --, when normalized to the local observations, provides a surprisingly simple but accurate description of the cosmic star formation history and other observable quantities. Our consensus model has the following global parameters at z=0: Omega_* = 0.0023+-0.0005, I_EBL = 45+-9 nW m^-2 sr^-1, rho_SFR = (1.06+-0.22)e-2 Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3, j_bol = (3.3+-0.4)e8 Lsun Mpc^-3. Also it shows an essentially constant star formation rate from z=7 to z=2.},

 abstract = {  The unprecedented range of second-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories calls for refining the predictions of potential sources and detection rates. The coalescence of double compact objects (DCOs)---i.e., neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS), and black hole-black hole (BH-BH) binary systems---is the most promising source of GWs for these detectors. We compute detection rates of coalescing DCOs in second-generation GW detectors using the latest models for their cosmological evolution, and implementing inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) gravitational waveform models in our signal-to-noise ratio calculations. We find that: (1) the inclusion of the merger/ringdown portion of the signal does not significantly affect rates for NS-NS and BH-NS systems, but it boosts rates by a factor $\sim 1.5$ for BH-BH systems; (2) in almost all of our models BH-BH systems yield by far the largest rates, followed by NS-NS and BH-NS systems, respectively, and (3) a majority of the detectable BH-BH systems were formed in the early Universe in low-metallicity environments. We make predictions for the distributions of detected binaries and discuss what the first GW detections will teach us about the astrophysics underlying binary formation and evolution.},

 abstract = {  The development of advanced gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO and Virgo, provides impetus to refine theoretical predictions for what these instruments might detect. In particular, with the range increasing by an order of magnitude, the search for GW sources is extending beyond the ``local'' Universe and out to cosmological distances. Double compact objects (neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) and black hole-black hole (BH-BH) systems) are considered to be the most promising gravitational wave sources. In addition, NS-NS and/or BH-NS systems are thought to be the progenitors of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and may also be associated with macronovae. In this paper we present the merger event rates of these objects as a function of cosmological redshift. We provide the results for four cases, each one investigating a different important evolution parameter of binary stars. Each case is also presented for two metallicity evolution scenarios. We find that (i) in most cases NS-NS systems dominate the merger rates in the local Universe, while BH-BH mergers dominate at high redshift; (ii) BH-NS mergers are less frequent that other sources per unit volume, for all time; and (iii) natal kicks may alter the observable properties of populations in a significant way, allowing the underlying models of binary evolution and compact object formation to be easily distinguished. This is the second paper in a series of three. The third paper will focus on calculating the detection rates of mergers by gravitational wave telescopes.},

 abstract = {  By combining advances in observational astrophysics with recent progress in stellar evolution, we show that there will be a remarkably high number of black holes with compact object (neutron star or black hole) companions in the local Universe. Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (300,000 galaxies) indicates that recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar metallicity), and the other half form with small contribution of elements heavier than Helium (20% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss derive significantly higher stellar-origin black hole masses (30-80 Msun) than previously estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to estimate the probability for detection of gravitational waves arising from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a low metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one black hole. In particular, we find the gravitational-wave detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture of solar and 10% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the largest instruments to double neutron-star binaries (VIRGO: 9 Mpc; LIGO: 18) is not high enough to ensure a first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future instrument increased the reach to 50-100Mpc, a detection of gravitational waves would be expected within the first year of observation. It was previously thought that binary neutron stars were the most likely source, but our results indicate that black-hole binaries are 25-times more likely. We are therefore truly on the cusp of seeing gravitational waves, and the first source ever to be seen is likely to be a black hole binary.},

  abstract = { We present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with proper motion measurements. The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants. After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41 per cent using interferometers and the remaining 1 per cent using optical telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse velocities, respectively) derived from these measurements are somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6)kms-1, respectively. The corresponding mean 2D speeds are 246(22) and 87(13)kms-1. PSRs B2011+38 and B2224+64 have the highest inferred 2D speeds of ~1600 km s-1. We study the mean speeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73 pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3Myr, we find the mean three-dimensional (3D) pulsar birth velocity to be 400(40)kms-1. The distribution of velocities is well described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1D rms sigma= 265 km s-1. There is no evidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. The proper motions for PSRs B1830-08 and B2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations with the supernova remnants W41 and G114.3+0.3, respectively.}

 abstract = {  LIGO has detected gravitational waves from the coalescence and merger of two massive stellar-origin black holes. The detection is consistent with our earlier predictions that the first LIGO detections from massive binary black hole mergers were imminent, based on isolated binary evolution. <br />Within our classical evolutionary scenario we find that the stellar progenitors of the black holes constituting GW150914 most likely formed in low metallicity environments (Z&lt;10\% Zsun). We also find a bimodal distribution for the formation time of GW150914, with a peak only 2 Gyr after the Big Bang (z=3) and another (30\% lower) peak in the relatively recent past at 11 Gyr (z=0.2). The typical channel for the formation of GW150914 involves two very massive stars (40-100 Msun) that interacted once through stable mass transfer and once through common envelope evolution, and both black holes formed without their progenitors exploding as supernovae. The existence of GW150914 indicates that large natal kicks (&gt;400 km/s) for massive black holes are unlikely. Development and survival of the common envelope is likely restricted to evolved stars. While models based on dynamical formation do not predict that the BH spins should be preferentially aligned with the binary angular momentum, our models of isolated BH-BH formation favor aligned BH spins (assuming that the progenitor star spins are aligned when the binaries form). We find that the existence of GW150914 does not require enhanced double black hole formation in dense stellar clusters or via exotic evolutionary channels. Our standard model BH-BH merger rate (200 Gpc^-3 yr^-1) is consistent with the LIGO empirical estimate (2-400 Gpc^-3 yr^-1) and it is 40 times higher than the typical rate of dynamically formed mergers. We predict that BH-BH mergers with total mass of 20-80 Msun are to be detected next.},
