\section{Introduction}
% POINT: LIGO soon will detect compact binary mergers....
%     ... and possibly EM counter part too
%     ... which will enable new physics
Gravitational waves have been detected from  coalescing  black hole binaries \citep{DetectionPaper,LIGO-O1-BBH}. 
Over the next few years, ground-based gravitational wave detectors like LIGO 
and Virgo  should detect the gravitational
wave signal from many more similar merging compact binaries \citep{LIGO-O1-BBH,RatesPaper,gwastro-EventPopsynPaper-2016}, as well as  binary  neutron stars and black hole-neutron star binaries \citep{LIGO-Inspiral-Rates,popsyn-LowMetallicityImpact2c-StarTrackRevised-2014}.
%
The host galaxies of gravitational wave sources will identified, either directly or statistically.  
On the one hand, addition to the strong gravitational wave signal, mergers of neutron stars are expected to  frequently be accompanied by detectable
electromagnetic radiation  via a number of  mechanisms, including a strong but tightly beamed
ultrarelativistic jet and weakly-beamed but more isotropic thermal radiation from an expanding hot shell
\citep[see,e.g.,][and references therein]{2013PhRvL.111r1101C,short-grb-GWCoincidenceEM-MetzgerBerger2011}.  
% People we can't afford the space to cite, alas:
%    - 2015arXiv150101986H   -
%    - 2013MNRAS.430.2121P - Rosswog recent
%    - Shibata group/Koutarou
In addition to providing a wealth of information about the merger event itself, a multimessenger detection will pin down
the sky position and therefore approximate birthplace of each merging binary.    
%
On the other hand, gravitational wave detectors can perform high-precision sky and volumetric localization \cite{2016LRR....19....1A,2016arXiv160307333S}.  As GW detector
networks increase in sensitivity, these localizations will allow statistical and, eventually, unique identification of
host galaxies directly, even without associated electromagnetic emission.
%
As with supernovae and  GRBs, these host galaxy associations   are expected to tightly constrain models for compact binary
formation; see, for comparison,  \citet{2011MNRAS.412.1508M}, \citet{long-grb-GuettaPiran2007},
\citet{2014ARAA..52...43B}, and references therein. %2010ApJ...722.1879M,2010MNRAS.407.1314M}.     
%

% POINT: Huge detail possible
The host galaxies of distant short GRBs have already been extensively investigated, with the associations being used to
draw preliminary conclusions about their progentitors  \cite{2014ARAA..52...43B}.   
%Of necessity, these analyses  on bulk correlations, often stacked to increase significance across multiple sources
%\editremark{clean up/don't piss off   Edo}.  
Unlike GRBs, detected gravitational wave sources will be limited by the range of LIGO to the local universe; for
example,  binary neutron star sources should be closer than $400\unit{Mpc}$.  Due to their proximity, each host galaxy
can be explored at great depth and detail via  position-resolved spectroscopy, enabling detailed position-resolved star-formation
and chemical evolution histories \editremark{citation: need better ones} \citep[see,e.g.][]{2009MNRAS.396..462K,2014MNRAS.444..336C}. \jillianremark{Do you want citations of GRB host observations or just general galaxy stuff?}
% POINT: But is it useful?
In this work, we demonstrate by concrete example that detailed analysis of individual galaxies can be essential to
investigate key physical questions about the origin of compact binary mergers. 



This paper is organized as follows. 
In \S \ref{sec:sims}, we describe detailed hydrodynamical simulations of  two galaxies.  Though these two
galaxies are at  present similar to the Milky Way, we
show that their star formation and chemical evolution history have subtle but important differences due to their
distinctive merger histories.   To demonstrate
these differences have a significant practical impact,  in \S \ref{sec:model}, we introduce a simple,
metallicity-dependent  phenomenological model to calculate the present-day rate and mass distribution of compact binary
mergers from  a galaxy's known history.   In \S \ref{sec:results:BBH}, we use this model to demonstrate the binary black hole coalescence rate
depends sensitively on the galaxy's assembly history, in a manner which is far from apparent from its present-day
properties.  
In \S \ref{sec:results} we show that while these two galaxy formation models should produce comparable detectable binary neutron star
populations, these two scenarios could produce dramatically different populations of electromagnetically detectable
merging black hole-neutron star binaries.

\section{Cosmological simulations produce two distinct Milky-Way-like galaxies}
\label{sec:sims}

\subsection{Simulating galaxy evolution}
To thoroughly study the significance of low metallicity star
formation, we examine cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) $N$-body simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies with GASOLINE
\citep{2001PhDT........21S,2004NewA....9..137W}.  These simulations allow us to analyze both
spatially and temporally resolved star formation, and determine not
only the metallicity history of compact object progenitors, but also
their dynamical evolution.  
%maybe move the below section to later and/or consolidate
One simulation we report here, $h258$,
involves the formation of a Milky Way-like disk galaxy whose
progenitors undergo major mergers at $z = 2$ and $z = 0.8$.  This
simulation has been previously discussed by
\citet{2009MNRAS.398..312G,2010ApJ...721L.148B,2011ApJ...742...13B,2011ApJ...728...51B}; however we have
re-run the simulation at a factor of two higher in spatial resolution
and additionally included new physics including a prescription for
cooling by molecular hydrogen \citet{2012MNRAS.425.3058C}.

We selected our simulated region of interest from a 50 Mpc volume of
uniform resolution, and resampled the region at very high
resolution using the volume renormalization technique \citep{1993ApJ...412..455K}.
This technique allows us to follow the detailed physical processes
involved in galaxy evolution in our selected region while still
including large-scale torques from cosmic structure.  We use
WMAP3 cosmology \citep{WMAP} and model the ionizing UV background
with the prescription from \citet{1996ApJ...461...20H}.  Stars form
probabilistically from gas particles which meet density ($n_{min} =
10$ amu cm$^{-3}$) and temperature ($T_{max} = 10^4$ K) thresholds. If a gas
particle meets these criteria, it has a likelihood of forming a star
particle (representing a simple stellar population with a Kroupa IMF
\citep{2001MNRAS.322..231K}) which is given by

\begin{equation}
p = \frac{m_{\rm gas}}{m_{\rm star}} (1 - e^{c^*\rm X_{\rm H_2} \Delta t/t_{\rm form}})
\end{equation}

\noindent
where the star formation efficiency parameter $c^*$ is set to 0.1 such
that our galaxies match the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt law
\citep{1989ApJ...344..685K};  X$_{\rm H_2}$ is the molecular hydrogen fraction of the gas particle; $m_{star}$ and $m_{gas}$ are the star and gas
particle masses;\footnote{In our high-resolution simulations \textbf{ROS-check!}\jillianremark{this number is correct, is that what you want to check? - JMB}, each gas particle starts with a mass
  $m_{gas,0}=26,676 M_\odot$, gaining mass from feedback and losing it to star formation.  Each star particle, when
  formed, has $1/3$ of the progenitor mass of the forming gas particle.  See \cite{2010ApJ...717..121C} for a discussion
of resolution issues in these SPH simulations.} $t_{form}$ is the dynamical time for the gas
particle; and $\Delta t$ is the time between star formation episodes,
which we set to 1 Myr.  We model supernova feedback using the
blastwave formalism described in \citet{1977ApJ...218..148M} and implemented in
our simulations as in \citet{2006MNRAS.373.1074S}.  Each supernova releases
$E_{SN} = 10^{51}$ erg into the surrounding gas with a radius
determined by the blastwave equations.  These particles are not
allowed to cool for the duration of the blastwave, mimicking the
snowplow phase of a supernova explosion.  Previous works have found
that this set of parameters results in realistic galaxies which obey a
number of observed relations such as the mass-metallicity relation
\citep{2007ApJ...655L..17B}, the Tully-Fisher relation \citep{2009MNRAS.398..312G}, and
the size-luminosity relation \citep{2011ApJ...728...51B}, as well as reproduce
the detailed characteristics of bulgeless dwarf galaxies
\citep{2010Natur.463..203G} and the Milky Way \citep{2011ApJ...742...76G}.


Also included in our simulations is a scheme for turbulent metal
diffusion \citep{2010MNRAS.407.1581S}.  Metals are created in supernova explosions
and deposited directly to the gas within the blast radius.  Stellar
masses are converted to ages as described by \citet{1996A&A...315..105R}, and
stars more massive than 8 M$_\odot$ are able to undergo a Type II
supernova.  We follow metal enrichment from both Type II and Type 1a
supernova, with metal yields derived from \citet{1993PhR...227...65W} and
\citet{1986A&A...158...17T} respectively.  From this point onwards metals
diffuse through the surrounding gas, according to 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dZ}{dt}|_{diff} = \nabla (D \nabla {Z}) \\
\end{equation}
%
where the diffusion paremeter $D$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
D = C_{diff} |S_{ij}| h
\end{equation}
%
and $h$ is the SPH smoothing length, $S_{ij}$ is the trace-free shear
tensor, and $C_{diff}$ is a dimensionless constant which we set to a conservative value of 0.03.  

%Sijing finds that C = 0.05 makes for a good comparison to clusters, and that C = 0.05 - 0.1 is expected from turbulence theory.

We identify individual galaxies using the halo finder $AHF$
\citep{2004MNRAS.351..399G,2009ApJS..182..608K}, which identifies halos based on an
overdensity criterion for a flat universe \citep{1997PhDT........14G}.  For this
work, we are focusing on the primary (i.e. most massive) galaxy at any
given redshift, which serves as the progenitor to our $z = 0$ Milky
Way-like galaxy.



\subsection{Two Milky-Way-like galaxies with distinct histories }

{\bf Richard go ahead and edit this however is needed.}  The evolution
of a galaxy, in terms of its stellar mass and metallicity evolution,
depends strongly on its interaction history.  Galaxies which appear
similar at the present day may have had drastically different
histories, which may result in differences in compact object merger
rates.  To investigate whether galaxy history affects the GRB event
rate, we have chosen two simulations which are extremely similar at $z
= 0$ but differ strongly in their merger histories.

The simulation h277 (Boring Galaxy) is a Milky Way analog with a
quiescent merger history.  It experiences its last major merger at $z
= 3$, after which a small number of minor interactions permeate its
life.  This simulation has been shown to emulate several Milky Way
properties, including stellar dynamics
\citep{2012ApJ...758L..23L,2014ApJ...794..151L,2014ApJ...790...89K}, baryon fraction
\citep{2013ApJ...766...56M}, halo properties \citep{2009ApJ...702.1058Z,2010ApJ...721..738Z}, and
disk properties \citep{2011ApJ...728...51B}.  It has a virial mass of $M_{vir} =
6.79 \times 10^{11} \msun$, stellar mass $M_* = 4.24 \times 10^{10}
\msun$, and maximum circular velocity $v_{circ} = 235$ km s$^{-1}$.

  The simulation h258 (Exciting Galaxy), on the other hand, has a much
  more active merger history.  At $z = 1$ there is a 1:1 merger event;
  a gas disk rapidly reforms following the collision (see
  \citet{2009MNRAS.398..312G}), resulting in a massive disk galaxy at $z = 0$
  which looks remarkably similar to the Milky Way and to the other
  simulation, h277.  Prior to the $z = 1$ merger, each of the two
  progenitor galaxies actually experiences its own additional major
  merger events around $z = 2$.  The combination of
  the series of major mergers, plus a number of minor interactions and
  flybys, gives a stark contrast to the relatively quiescent history
  of h277.  At $z = 0$, h258 has a virial mass of $M_{vir} = 7.74
  \times 10^{11} \msun$, stellar mass $M_* = 4.46 \times 10^{10}
  \msun$, and maximum circular velocity $v_{circ} = 242$ km s$^{-1}$.  \editremark{Might we want to show the images of these galaxies?}


  Due to the differences in merger histories, the metallicity
  evolution of h258 and h277 also differ at early times.  Figure
  \ref{fig:TwoGalaxies} shows the history of the mean metallicty of
  recently formed stars vs time (thick solid lines), where we define
  recent as within the past 50 Myr.  The shaded regions correspond to
  one standard devation of the mean, while the thick dashed lines
  represent the top and bottom 90\%.  We see that the early evolution
  of the metal properties of these galaxies does differ - between 0.5
  and 6 Gyr, h277 hosts a {\bf modestly} more metal-rich population than
  h258. \editremark{The difference isn't all that big, I want to address it without sounding foolish.}

merger of  near the peak of their
star-forming history, newly-born stars are created with significantlydifferent metallicity.  Additionally, prior to the
second major merger of galaxy B at $\simeq 6\unit{Gyr}$, stars form in the ``exciting'' galaxy at a systematically lower
metallicity than in the ``boring'' counterpart.

\section{Model for compact binary formation}
\label{sec:model}


Binary evolution calculations suggest the detection rate depends sensitively on the assumed metallicity, in conjuction
with other parameters \citep[see,\,e.g.][and references
  therein]{popsyn-LowMetallicityImpact-Chris2008,popsyn-LIGO-SFR-2008}.\editremark{New dominik et al}
% POINT: 
%   - final BH spin, mass can change number favored
%   - of course
The detected population of compact binary mergers can further favor low-metallicity environments, e.g. through the total
mass of merging binaries. \jillianremark{The previous sentence is confusing - rephrase?  I have trouble with ``the detected population can further favor low-Z environments'' because that makes no sense.}
% POINT: Simple model to encompass all
To explore plausible binary detection scenarios, we adopt a parameterized formalism for binary evolution and event detection, motivated by
the detailed studies of  \abbrvPSgrb{} and \abbrvPSellipticals.  Specifically, we encapsulate all information about
 binary evolution into two  parameterized response functions.  The funciton ${\cal G}(t| Z) =
dN/dt dM_*$ describes how many mergers per unit initial mass occur after a time $t$ since a starburst,
given ambient metallicity $Z$.  The function $p(m_1,m_2|Z)$ is a metallicity-dependent mass distribution for binaries
formed in a metallicity $Z$.
%
Finally, we account for the substantially increased sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors to binaries of larger
chirp mass $\mc=(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}/(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}$; see \abbrvPSellipticals.
%
In terms of this response function, we can therefore calculate the relative contribution to the LIGO  event rate $r_D$
due to any individual galaxy via the following formula 
\begin{widetext}
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:RatePerGalaxy}
\begin{eqnarray}
r_D  &\equiv& \int^{0}_{-T_{univ}} dt' d\log Z  \, [\dot{M}_*(t') p(\log Z|t) ] \times \; {\cal G}(0-t' | Z)  
 [\int d\mc p(\mc|Z) (\mc/1.2 M_\odot)^{15/6}]
%\\
%% {\cal R}(z)&\equiv &  \int dx {\cal R} p(z)
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
\end{widetext}
In this expression, the galactic star formation rate
$\dot{M}_*$ and star formation metallicity distribution $p(\log Z|t)$ are galaxy-dependent and drawn from our
simulations.   \editremark{rewrite this to be average chirp mass at a given metallicity}


We parameterize the response function ${\cal G}(t|Z)$ with two factors: (a) an overall efficiency $\lambda$ for forming
binaries;  and (b) a
cumulative delay time distribution $P_t(<t|Z)$, describing the fraction of binaries born at $t=0$ that merge in less
than time $t$ from a population of binaries $Z$:\footnote{For simplicity, we assume the mass and delay time
  distributions are uncorrelated.  Figure A9 in \abbrvPSgrb{} shows this approximation, while not strictly true, is an
  excellent approximation for merging BH-BH binaries at solar metallicity.  }
\begin{eqnarray}
G(t,x|Z) &=& \lambda(Z) p_x(x|Z) \frac{dP_t}{dt}(t) 
\end{eqnarray}
Previous studies suggest the number of merging compact binaries $\lambda \delta M_*$ produced by a starburst depends
as a power law on metallicity:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:LambdaVersusZModel}
\lambda(Z) &=& \lambda_o \text{max}[(Z/Z_\odot)^{-a}, F_{max}] 
\end{eqnarray}
with $a\in [0,3]$ and $F_{max}<10^3$
%$\lambda_o F_{max} < 3\times 10^{-4}/M_\odot$
 (see, e.g.\cite{popsyn-LIGO-SFR-2008}, \abbrvKBLowZa).
In this paper we only investigate the dependence of rates with metallicity; we therefore  adopt 
\[
\lambda_0 = 10^{-3}/M_\odot
\]
as a typical value for neutron star compact binaries (see \abbrvPSgrb{}, \abbrvPSellipticals, and \abbrvKBLowZa).
%


For binaries containing neutron stars, for simplicity we adopt the universal delay time distribution
%% Finally, we parameterize the delay time distribution by  either
%% \begin{eqnarray}
%% P_t(<t) &=& \begin{cases}
%% 0 & t<10 \unit{Myr} \\
%% (t/13\unit{Gyr})^{b}& t \in [10\unit{Myr},t_H]
%% \end{cases} 
%% \end{eqnarray}
%% with $b> 0$ or as the special case
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dP_t(<t)}{dt} =  \begin{cases}
0 & t<10 \unit{Myr} \\
\frac{1}{t \ln (13 \unit{Gyr}/10\unit{Myr})} & t \in [10\unit{Myr},13\unit{Gyr}]
\end{cases} 
\end{eqnarray}
\abbrvPSgrb{} and \abbrvPSellipticals{} show this distribution is reasonable approximations to compact binary delay
time distributions.\footnote{Simulations suggest the delay time distribution varies from model to model and with mass.
  These variations have less impact on our results than the evolving metallicity distribution of star forming gas.}
%
For suitable choices of parameter, our phenomenological response function is qualitatively consistent with the results of detailed simulations of binary
evolution  \citep{2010ApJ...715L.138B,popsyn-LowMetallicityImpact2c-StarTrackRevised-2014,popsyn-LowMetallicityImpact2b-StarTrackRevised-2013,popsyn-LowMetallicityImpact2-StarTrackRevised-2012}.


For binary black holes formed near solar metallicity, the delay time distribution can favor long delays between birth
and merger, as demonstrated in \abbrvPSellipticals{}.

Figure 2 of  \cite{2016arXiv160508783L} is an extreme example of this well-known trend

\section{Implications for transient multimessenger astronomy}


% POINT: Observations provide sample of extragalactic  binaries at merger, and  host galaxies.  Possible to mine large archive of events
% to deduce correlations

On the one hand,  relatively few formation scenarios will correctly reproduce the observed mass and spin distributions
\citep{2004MNRAS.352.1372B,2003ApJ...589L..37B,gwastro-Ilya-ConfProc-NRDA-2010}.  
% POINT: Value of associations
%% Green's function connecting the merger
%% rate $dN/dt$ to the star formation rate host galaxy star formation history and metallicity,
%% both the delay time distribution and correlation any preference for different metallicities can be determined
On the other hand, each host galaxy associates a merger to a unique star formation history and metallicity distribution.
With many events, these associations can potentially determine the ``response function'' for compact binaries: how often star forming gas of a given metallicity evolves into
merging compact binaries;  see, e.g., studies of

%
Highly atypical formation scenarios seemingly should produce events in or near atypical hosts.  
% POINT: Introduce *idea* of comparison: refs for mass-metallicity relation
For example, in the local universe galaxies lie along mass-metallicity  (\cite{2004ApJ...613..898T}; see also
\cite{sfr-ZEvolution-ByGalaxy-Panter2008})
or mass-metallicity-star formation rate  correlations (e.g., \cite{2010MNRAS.408.2115M}).
% POINT: Evolution tricky
[The change in these correlations with redshift is still being investigated; see, e.g., \editremark{citation: Panter;
    Mannucci; }, \cite{2011ApJ...739....1L} and references therein.]
% POINT: previous studies
Based on these correlations, both short  and long GRBs seem to arise from
relatively typical hosts at their redshift; see, e.g., \cite{grb-short-Hosts-Berger2008} and \cite{grb-long-HostMetallicityVsTrend-Mannucci2010}.


%  - Host associations: lots of information
Host galaxy associations provide rich information about a transient's present and past environment.
%
For example, in several cases the metallicity of gas neighboring a long GRB (\citet{ 2008AJ....135.1136M}; \citet{2010AJ....140.1557L}
\editremark{links}), short GRB (\editremark{XXX}), or SN has been directly measured.
%
The precise host offset can be compared to the distribution of light and star formation  \citep{2010ApJ...708....9F}.
%
Finally,  on a host-by-host basis, the delay time between birth and merger has been constrained for long GRBs (\editremark{XXX}), short GRBs \citep{2010ApJ...725.1202L}, and
  SN Ia \citep{2011MNRAS.412.1508M}.
%



Biases towards low-metallicity star formation have been extensively studied in the context of long GRBs and their host galaxies.
%
For example, \cite{2009ApJ...702..377K} demonstrated that a sufficiently strong bias towards low-metallicity star formation would predict
most  events in the local universe occur low-mass and dwarf galaxies.
%<
For less extreme metallicity biases, subsequent calculations by  \citet{2011MNRAS.417..567N} demonstrated that the
metallicity distribution within galaxies will usually lead to events in a wide range of host galaxies in the local universe.

\subsection{Local metallicity measurements?}
To this point, we have emphasized \emph{global} measurements of the galactic star formation history.  With the advent of
IFUs and position-resolved spectroscopy, observers can now probe the star formation history and metallicity of
individual gas packets at different points in a galaxy.  
%
These highly-detailed probes will be essential tools to develop a comprehensive model of the galaxy's merger and
chemical evolution history.  That said, the metallicity of stars and gas adjacent to a specific merger event provides
few direct, unambiguous clues to a compact binary merger's progenitors.  
On the one hand, compact binaries are kicked by supernovae, moving substantially away from their birth position
%  2014arXiv1407.3796S : implications for nucleosynthesis
\cite{2013ApJ...776...18F,2014ARAA..52...43B}. 
On the other hand, particularly during the epoch of galaxy formation, galaxies are well-mixed: stars and adjacent gas generally do not have
similar chemical composition.  
% POINT: Host tracer gas --we are optimistically assuming the metallicity 
%  can be measured.  A seperate question is whether you can measure Z in the local environment at all.
These mixing effects have been previously recognized as an obstacle to interpreting transient event spectra.  For
example,   \cite{2010MNRAS.402.1523P} previously demonstrated that absorbing gas neighboring transient events (there, long GRBs)
would generally have high metallicity, even for low-metallicity progenitors.   
%
\citet{2010MNRAS.402.1523P} have previously used hydrodynamical simulations to demonstrate that observed ambient
metallicities (there, using damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers in the host) do not tightly constrain the metallicity
distribution of the progenitor; see, e.g., their Fig 3.

\section{Conclusions}



* BBH properties far from apparent.  No surprise: delays can be long \cite{PSellipticals,popsyn-LowMetallicityImpact2b-StarTrackRevised-2013,gwastro-EventPopsynPaper-2016}, particularly because formation in low Z favored,
so system changes significantly from assembly conditions

* EM counterpart properties: delay times are shorter, so more of a surprise that formation scenario matters.  However,
BH properties depend on $Z$, which can influence the mass and spin of BHs that produce EM counterparts.



* Detailed analysis of one host galaxy presented in this work is complementary to the population-based approach used in
\cite{2016arXiv160508783L}, which favored formation in a wide range of galaxies and event times.   % that analysis also
                                % used a poor input from BSE, about the coalescence delay
