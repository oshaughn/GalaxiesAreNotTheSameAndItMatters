Recent binary evolution simulations suggest the compact binary merger rate depends

\section{Introduction}

\section{Cosmological simulations produce two distinct Milky-Way-like galaxies}

\subsection{Simulating galaxy evolution}
To thoroughly examine the significance of low metallicity star
formation, we have run a cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) $N$-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with GASOLINE
\citep{Stadel01,Wadsley04}.  This simulation allows us to analyze both
spatially and temporally resolved star formation, and determine not
only the metallicity history of compact object progenitors, but also
their dynamical evolution.  The simulation we report here, $h258$,
involves the formation of a Milky Way-like disk galaxy whose
progenitors undergo major mergers at $z = 2$ and $z = 0.8$.  This
simulation has been previously discussed by
\citet{Governato09,Bellovary10,Bellovary11,Brooks11}; however we have
re-run the simulation at a factor of two higher in spatial resolution
and additionally included new physics including a prescription for
cooling by molecular hydrogen (Christensen et al. in prep).

We selected our simulated region of interest from a 50 Mpc volume of
uniform resolution, and resampled the region of interest at very high
resolution using the volume renormalization technique \citep{Katz93}.
This technique allows us to follow the detailed physical processes
involved in galaxy evolution in our selected region while still
including large-scale torques from cosmic structure.  We use {\bf
WMAPX} cosmology \citep{WMAP} and model the ionizing UV background
with the prescription from \citet{Haardt96}.  Stars form
probabilistically from gas particles which meet density ($n_{min} =
10$ amu cm$^{-3}$) and temperature ($T_{max} = 10^4$ K) thresholds
{\bf (additional description needed for H2 SF prescription)}. If a gas
particle meets these criteria, it has a likelihood of forming a star
particle (representing a simple stellar population with a Kroupa IMF
\citep{Kroupa}) which is given by

\begin{equation}
p = \frac{m_{\rm gas}}{m_{\rm star}} (1 - e^{c^*\Delta t/t_{\rm form}})
\end{equation}

\noindent
where the star formation efficiency parameter $c^*$ is set to 0.1 such
that our galaxies match the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt law
\citep{Kennicutt89}; $m_{star}$ and $m_{gas}$ are the star and gas
particle masses;\footnote{In our high-resolution simulations \textbf{ROS-check!}, each gas particle starts with a mass
  $m_{gas,0}=26,676 M_\odot$, gaining mass from feedback and losing it to star formation.  Each star particle, when
  formed, has $1/3$ of the progenitor mass of the forming gas particle.  See \cite{2010ApJ...717..121C} for a discussion
of resolution issues in these SPH simulations.} $t_{form}$ is the dynamical time for the gas
particle; and $\Delta t$ is the time between star formation episodes,
which we set to 1 Myr.  We model supernova feedback using the
blastwave formalism described in \citet{McKee77} and implemented in
our simulations as in \citet{Stinson06}.  Each supernova releases
$E_{SN} = 10^{51}$ erg into the surrounding gas with a radius
determined by the blastwave equations.  These particles are not
allowed to cool for the duration of the blastwave, mimicking the
snowplow phase of a supernova explosion.  Previous works have found
that this set of parameters results in realistic galaxies which obey a
number of observed relations such as the mass-metallicity relation
\citep{Brooks07}, the Tully-Fisher relation \citep{Governato09}, and
the size-luminosity relation \citep{Brooks11}, as well as reproduce
the detailed characteristics of bulgeless dwarf galaxies
\citep{Governato10} and the Milky Way \citep{Guedes11}.


Also included in our simulations is a scheme for turbulent metal
diffusion \citep{Shen10}.  Metals are created in supernova explosions
and deposited directly to the gas within the blast radius.  Stellar
masses are converted to ages as described by \citet{Raiteri96}, and
stars more massive than 8 M$_\odot$ are able to undergo a Type II
supernova.  We follow metal enrichment from both Type II and Type 1a
supernova, with metal yields derived from \citet{Weaver93} and
\citet{Thielemann86} respectively.  From this point onwards metals
diffuse through the surrounding gas, according to 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dZ}{dt}|_{diff} = \nabla (D \nabla {Z}) \\
\end{equation}
%
where the diffusion paremeter $D$ is given by
%
\begin{equation}
D = C_{diff} |S_{ij}| h
\end{equation}
%
and $h$ is the SPH smoothing length, $S_{ij}$ is the trace-free shear
tensor, and $C_{diff}$ is a dimensionless constant which we set to
{\bf something.  Reasons for setting it are good, let's have some.
Sijing finds that C = 0.05 makes for a good comparison to clusters, we
tend to use something more conservative}.

We identify individual galaxies using the halo finder $AHF$
\citep{Gill04,Knollmann09}, which identifies halos based on an
overdensity criterion for a flat universe \citep{Gross97}.  For this
work, we are focusing on the primary (i.e. most massive) galaxy at any
given redshift, which serves as the progenitor to our $z = 0$ Milky
Way-like galaxy.

Intro
  -Important (edo/Brian)
  - More important soon (LIGO; IFU's give detail)
    because these galaxies are local and spatially resolved
    at 400 Mpc distance
  - The question: can we learn about things from detailed host galaxy 
    observations, and if so what?
    Obviously yes (cf. SN Ia, short GRB, etc)
  - Specific questions of interest, particularly for BH-NS origin for short GRBs:
    is there dependence of the event rate and BH mass on the source metallicity

  - Not clear because of kicks, mixing
  - Goal of paper: address this challenge via simulations

Methods
  - JB: specifically target two 'identical' MW galaxies (and their subhalo population)
  - Postproces JB: rhodot; Z of star forming gas
  - Model:
      - predict present-day number (and mass distribution) by formula 

Results:
  - Different histories which look the same now can produce different answers
